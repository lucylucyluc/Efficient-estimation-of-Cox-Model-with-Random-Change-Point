# Efficient-estimation-of-Cox-Model-with-Random-Change-Point

In the maincode, there are two codes for the paper "Efficient estimation of Cox Model with Random Change Point".

The first code, "RCPFREE", was developed for cox model with covariate-free rondom change point. It is worth noting that the distribution of random change points in this code is a truncated normal distribution, which can be replaced by any distribution. 

The second code, "RCPDEPENDENT", was developed for cox model with covariate-dependent rondom change point.  In this code, the error follows a normal distribution, which can be replaced by any distribution.
