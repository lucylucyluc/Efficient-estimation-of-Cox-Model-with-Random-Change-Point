# Efficient-estimation-of-Cox-Model-with-Random-Change-Point

In the maincode, there are two codes for the paper "Efficient estimation of Cox Model with Random Change Point".

The first code, "RCPFREE", is for cox model with covariate-free rondom change point. It is worth noting that the distribution of random change points in this code is a truncated normal distribution, which can be replaced by any distribution. 

The second code, "RCPDEPENDENT", is for cox model with covariate-dependent rondom change point.  In this code, the error follows a normal distribution, which can be replaced by any distribution.
